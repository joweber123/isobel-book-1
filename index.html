            <h1>EFL in the Secondary </br>School Sector</h1>
              <p class ="extra-line-spacing">For decades the teaching of English as a foreign language in secondary schools has been, for TESOL and ELT, something of an elephant in the room.  Drawing on the school experiences, narratives, research reports and descriptions of the avowed effective practices of an international cohort of grassroots classroom practitioners and teacher educators, this book re-ignites a dormant interest in the sector.  It challenges the imbalance in existing power structures, and highlights, at times vividly, the damage that can be wrought when the outcomes of mainstream research are applied to a community which itself has not been a focus of the original research agenda.  Even more importantly, however, it illustrates how, often in the face of opposition and despite a lack of moral and material support, these teachers find ingenious ways to persevere with what they consider their ultimate mission; namely, that of contributing to the full development of their adolescent learners, cognitive,  social and emotional. The book is a salutary and timely reminder that research in this profession needs to broaden its focus beyond the constraints of SLA, in order to project a fuller more inclusive appreciation of TESOL, one which reflects the knowledge of all its member communities, including the wisdom and expertise of teachers of English as a foreign language in the secondary school sector.

            <h1>Isobel Rainey</h1>
            <p class ="extra-line-spacing">Isobel Rainey has worked for many years as a lecturer in Applied Linguistics: TESOL in the UK, and as a teacher and teacher educator in Europe, South America and the Middle and Far East.  She has also co-coordinated English for secondary school projects funded by the Department for International Development (DIFID, formerly ODA) and, for her work on one such project, she received an award from the Peruvian Ministry of Education. Her main research and academic publishing interests concern: the challenges facing, and research priorities of SS teachers of EFL working in non-mainstream contexts; the selection of themes for non-mainstream EFL textbooks; and the affective needs of ESL learners who are living and studying in isolated communities in centre countries.  Before retiring, she was a lecturer in Applied Linguistics: TESOL at the University of Surrey, Guildford, England.  In retirement, she has coordinated privately funded ESOL projects for asylum seekers and refugees in the UK and worked as a consultant for EFL teacher development programmes in Asia and Latin America.  In the course of her career, she has also been an oral examiner and external assessor for several examination boards, including the International Baccalaureate, Trinity College London and UCLES. She divides her time between the UK and Andalusia, where she provides support for secondary school teachers of EFL on a voluntary basis.

            <h1>Customer Reviews</h1>
            <p>At long last a book that focuses on the teaching of English as a foreign language in the secondary school sector, an area of TEFL which, for many years, has not been adequately researched by academics or written about in the literature.  This is an important and welcome contribution to TESOL literature in general. </p>
            <p><i>(Julio) Lima, Peru</i></p>
            <hr>
            <p> A very well-informed and extremely interesting research on grassroots teachers of English as a foreign language in secondary schools – that is, real teachers in everyday school practice in non-privileged bilingual contexts. An excellent study in a field that has been neglected by mainstream literature in the last decades, missing the peculiarities of adolescent learners. The author shows a wide range of readings on research reports, reflections on educational policies and direct observation of classroom practice in a variety of international contexts. I really recommend this book to all secondary EFL teachers as they can identify with the narratives of real experience in everyday teaching, find topics for reflection and compare methodologies in different contexts. One of the commonalities Isobel Rainey finds in the teachers she met all over the world is that many of us really care about the overall education of our students and try to help them be better people. Also a confidence-boosting book I recommend to all EFL teachers. </p>

              <p class= "modal-content-child">In the contents of the teachers’ narratives (chapter 4); in the research they conduct (chapter 5A); and in the classroom practices they claim are effective (chapter 5B), there is a marked concern, on the part of the SS teachers represented, with addressing the specific needs of adolescent learners by paying attention ‘to their attitudes, values, how they see the world - in short, to their reality’ (Widdowson, 2011, p. 12).  With the exception of the work of a few mainstream researchers (see below), this specific concern for adolescent SS learners is, quite aberrantly, absent from mainstream research agenda.  This situation, Faltis (1999) maintains, is reflected in the USA with respect to bilingualism and ESL at the SS level, which he describes as ‘the most unexamined and most overlooked areas of education in the United States’ (p. 1). Yet, as learners, adolescents have very specific cognitive, emotional and social needs.

              <p class= "modal-content-child">Whatever is currently affecting the political and socio-economic life of the community ( <i>Episodes 3 and 4</i> ) and whatever  goes on  regularly outside the classroom,  irrespective of political, social or economic change ( <i>Episodes 1, 2 and 5</i> ),  will, for better or worse, influence what goes on in the classroom. Pete and Gloria ( <i>Episodes 2 and 5</i> ) put it to good use. For Kate ( <i>Episode 1</i> ), it was like a tsunami, which completely submerged her lesson; and, for Lilia and Zofia ( <i>Episodes 3 and 4</i> ), it caused, in the case of the former, bewilderment and, in the case of the latter, elation. If given the opportunities to share, during TD programmes and in TESOL literature (see Appleby, 2010), how they exploit or deal with these outside realities in the classroom, teachers are likely to acquire a keener understanding of their own practices. At the very least, they should feel less alone when facing any challenges the realities may present.

              <span class="close">&times;</span>

              <p class= "modal-content-child">Despite the pressures they are under from major global economic powers, national governments, industry and big business, it is all the more noteworthy that teachers in this study reveal a determination to persevere with the notion of a broad liberal humanist education, which they do not sacrifice to the whims and volatility of the ultimately soul-destroying demands of the labour market (Ben-Peretz, 2001). What’s more, they often pursue, or endeavour to pursue, their vocational goals in conditions where the curricula are exclusively test-oriented or where management has long since abandoned its concern for providing learners, through the teaching of all subjects on the school curriculum, with strategies for living a good life.

              <span class="close">&times;</span>

              <p class= "modal-content-child">Second, the research into curriculum design reported by Fang (2012) and Kim (2012) indicates that  problems teachers encountered with curriculum reforms in China and South Korea are similar to those in other regions of the globe, for example, Eastern Europe and Latin America ( <i>see Episode 3, chapter 3, p. 76 and Narrative 1, chapter 4, p. 111</i> ).  Not least among those problems are the uncompensated-for increase in teachers’ workloads; the stress teachers experience because they and other stakeholders have not been properly prepared for the innovation; the absence of fit between the innovations and the contents of national tests and university entrance examinations; and, in the case of Kim’s research, the negative effect of the reform on adolescent learners’ self-esteem, self-confidence and motivation.

              <span class="close">&times;</span>

              <p class= "modal-content-child">For the grassroots SS teacher researchers of EFL represented in all these research projects, the route to successful teaching and learning is not, in the first instance, predicated solely on major curriculum reform or on techniques or technology; rather, it follows a path which starts with the teachers' sensitive appreciation of the context of teaching and learning, and follows a trajectory where success hinges on the establishment and maintenance of mutually nurturing teacher-student relationships.

              <span class="close">&times;</span>

              <p class= "modal-content-child">The absence of recognition of teachers is, what’s more, to the detriment of teachers’ well being (Scholes Gillings de González, 2011) as, in the case of many reforms, teachers are being forced into the role of ‘… a standardised performer of tasks increasingly defined by others’ (Goodson, 2006, p. 261) and, ‘seem to be regarded as mere deliverers of content that is not related to students’ lives, as trainers in skills that do not necessarily help students cope with issues they face every day’ (Echeverri Sucerquia & Pérez Restrepo, 2014, p.174).  This enforced robotic role damages not just the professional but also the emotional lives of teachers as it denies them the expression of the identity they wish to claim as their own.  As a result, the communal identity of grassroots SS teachers of EFL with its deeply embedded commitment to educating fully rounded and emotionally stable SS graduates remains very much on the margins of the TESOL mainstream.
