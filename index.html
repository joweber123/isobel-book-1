            <h1>EFL in the Secondary </br>School Sector</h1>
              <p>For decades the teaching of English as a foreign language in secondary schools has been, for TESOL and ELT, something of an elephant in the room. Drawing on the school experiences, narratives,
              research reports and descriptions of the avowed effective practices of an international cohort of grassroots classroom practitioners and teacher educators, this book re-ignites a dormant interest in the sector.</p>
              <p class="bold">It challenges the imbalance in existing power structures, and highlights, at times vividly, the damage that can be wrought when the outcomes of mainstream research are applied to a community which itself has not been a focus of the original research agenda. Even more importantly, however, it illustrates how, often in the face of opposition and despite a lack of moral and material support, these teachers find ingenious ways to persevere with what they consider their ultimate mission; namely, that of contributing to the full development of their adolescent learners, cognitive, social and emotional.
              <p>The book is a salutary and timely reminder that research in this profession needs to broaden its focus beyond the constraints of SLA, in order to project a fuller more inclusive appreciation of TESOL, one which reflects the knowledge of all its member communities, including that of the wisdom and expertise of teachers of English as a foreign language in the secondary school sector.</p>

            <h1>Isobel Rainey</h1>
            <p>Isobel Rainey has worked for many years as a lecturer in Applied Linguistics: TESOL in the UK and overseas, as a teacher and teacher educator in Europe, South America and the Middle and Far East. She has also authored several international EFL textbooks. Her main research interests concern: the priorities and coping strategies of secondary school EFL teachers working in non-mainstream contexts; and the affective needs of, and challenges facing, ES/FL and ‘bilingual’ learners who are living or studying in potentially alienating contexts. </p>
            <p>Isobel has also worked for several international language examination boards including the International Baccalaureate, Trinity College London and the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate. Before retiring, she was a lecturer in Applied Linguistics: TESOL at the University of Surrey, Guildford, England. In retirement, she has coordinated privately funded ESOL projects for asylum seekers and refugees in the UK, and participated in teacher development programmes for secondary school teachers in Asia and Latin America. Currently she lives in Andalusia where she supports secondary school teachers of EFL on a voluntary basis.
