            <h1>EFL in the Secondary </br>School Sector</h1>
              <p class ="extra-line-spacing">For decades the teaching of English as a foreign language in secondary schools has been, for TESOL and ELT, something of an elephant in the room.  Drawing on the school experiences, narratives, research reports and descriptions of the avowed effective practices of an international cohort of grassroots classroom practitioners and teacher educators, this book re-ignites a dormant interest in the sector.  It challenges the imbalance in existing power structures, and highlights, at times vividly, the damage that can be wrought when the outcomes of mainstream research are applied to a community which itself has not been a focus of the original research agenda.  Even more importantly, however, it illustrates how, often in the face of opposition and despite a lack of moral and material support, these teachers find ingenious ways to persevere with what they consider their ultimate mission; namely, that of contributing to the full development of their adolescent learners, cognitive,  social and emotional. The book is a salutary and timely reminder that research in this profession needs to broaden its focus beyond the constraints of SLA, in order to project a fuller more inclusive appreciation of TESOL, one which reflects the knowledge of all its member communities, including the wisdom and expertise of teachers of English as a foreign language in the secondary school sector.

            <h1>Isobel Rainey</h1>
            <p class ="extra-line-spacing">Isobel Rainey  has worked for many years as a lecturer in Applied Linguistics: TESOL in the UK, and as a teacher and teacher educator in Europe, South America and the Middle and Far East.  She has also co-coordinated English for secondary school projects funded by the Department for International Development (now DFID, formerly ODA) and, for her work on one such project, she received an award from the Peruvian Ministry of Education. Her main research and academic publishing interests concern: the challenges facing, and research priorities of, SS teachers of EFL working in non-mainstream contexts; the selection of themes for non-mainstream EFL textbooks; and the affective needs of ESL learners who are living and studying in isolated communities in centre countries.  Before retiring, she was a lecturer in Applied Linguistics: TESOL at the University of Surrey, Guildford, England.  In retirement, she has coordinated privately funded ESOL projects for asylum seekers and refugees in the UK and worked as a consultant for EFL teacher development programmes in Asia and Latin America.  In the course of her career, she has also been an oral examiner and external assessor for several examination boards, including the International Baccalaureate, Trinity College London and UCLES. She lives in Andalusia, where she provides support for secondary school teachers of EFL on a voluntary basis.
